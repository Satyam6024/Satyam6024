### 🧠 About Me

- 🎓 Former Mathematics wizard turned into a Machine Learning beast 🧙‍♂️📊
- 🏢 Currently working at **Salesforce** as a Data Scientist, driving insights that *actually* matter
- 🛠️ Tools of trade: `Python`, `SQL`, `Pandas`, `Scikit-Learn`, `TensorFlow`, `PyTorch`, `Docker`, `Airflow`
- 🤓 I didn't attend Stanford. I attended YouTube University and the School of Late-Night Debugging.
- ☁️ I speak fluent `Data`, some `SaaS`, and a whole lot of `Cloud`
- 📈 I like my models like I like my coffee — **well tuned and highly regularized** ☕️🔥
